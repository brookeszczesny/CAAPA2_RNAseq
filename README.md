## gene filtering, Differential expresson, WGCNA, manuscript plots

This repository contains the scripts used to generate RNAseq results for the CAAPA2 Multi-omics in nasal epithelium reveals three axes of dysregulation for asthma risk in the African Diaspora manuscript. These analyses were performed on the JHPCE cluster. Scripts include gene filtering for full, adult, and pediatric datasets, case/control gene differential expression analyses for full, adult, pediatric, and individual site datasets, WGCNA for identification of gene modules, case/control module differential expression analysis for full dataset, and figure generation.
